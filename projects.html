			<p><span class="desc">Summer 2015</span> - MIT has a collaboration with the <a href="https://sutd.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Singapore University of Technology and Design</a>, and over the summer, thirty students from SUTD come to MIT for the ten-week <a href="https://sutd.mit.edu/glp.html" target="_blank">Global Leadership Program</a>. As one of the MIT students in the program, I took design classes (pottery, architectural drawing), a wilderness class, and technical writing with the SUTD students. However, the main design project of the summer and the highlight of the program was to build an electric motor boat.</p>

			<p><span class="desc">Fall 2015</span> - When I was a freshman, I got involved with a new project called <a href="http://next.mit.edu/haunt/" target="_blank">Next Haunt</a>, a combination of haunted house and escape-the-room. We built a two-story wooden structure (complete with painted walls and roof) in the basement of our dorm right before Halloween. Teams entered the house and had to solve puzzles to escape while knowing that the undead was close behind them. I was a live actor (a spooooky zombie) my first year, and for my second year I returned as the lead puzzle designer.</p>

We explored the properties of structural shells and then created our own using a combination of ice, wax, and cloth.</p>

			<p><span class="desc">Fall 2016</span> - During orientation week, MIT invites all incoming freshmen to an evening at the New England Aquarium. They came expecting fish and penguins (and maybe some water Pokemon), but some upperclassmen and I surprised them with a bonus puzzle hunt! The freshmen competed in their orientation groups (or quickly made new friends to form a team), and the top three teams with the fastest solve times received puzzle-related prizes.</p>
