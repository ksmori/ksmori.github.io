      <h2>Thursday, April 2</h2>
      <p>I cleaned my desk before taking this, so you don't get to see the resident unwashed plate, random assorted papers, recent grocery receipts, remnants of tea, ret cetera. Theoretically, a neater workspace would make it easier to concentrate. However, my laptop is full of distractions. So that's going out next.</p>

      <p>Having an external monitor is definitely nice.</p>

      <h2>Tuesday, March 31</h2>
      <p>Marching onward to April tomorrow. Things I want to do more: journal, read, exercise, learn, talk with friends and John. Things I want to do less: mindlessly consume digital content, stay/wake up late and miss sunlight hours. These aren't that different from non-quarantine objectives, really.</p>
      <p>John found a new standing desk! Here he is, attending a virtual Computability and Logic class.</p>

      <p>Me, having to wake up before noon every day now to attend and TA classes.</p>

      <p>John watched Kiki's Delivery Service with Annabelle (virtually) last night. Jiji was also in attendance.</p>

      <h2>Saturday, March 28</h2>
      <p>The Summit has been quiet. John and I have stayed in all week. The weather alternates between lovely sun and dreary rain. I wonder if I am deficient in vitamin D.</p>
      <p>Time is passing in a strange way. Last weekend, I looked back at the first week and lamented how the days seemed to blend into one another, how each day felt much the same. However, looking closer, I was able to pick out reasonable differences for each day and be satisfied with that.</p>
      <p>This week was much worse. The days melted together, my activities varied less, and my perception of elapsed time has degraded. I will look back on it as an extremely subdued and lazy spring break. Next week, classes start, and even though I'm not sure that I'm ready for structure, it will certainly help.</p>
      <p>I am thankful for John's company, the nice space we occupy, and our ability to have delicious homecooked meals every night.</p>
      <hr class="small">
      <p>Sam and Helena baked some earl grey yogurt cake yesterday, and Adam made it today for Dhriti's birthday. I'm told they were both big hits. Happy birthday, Dhriti!</p>

      <hr class="small">
      <p>In other news, today I hopped on a chartered flight and visited Helena! We ran around in the balmy sunshine, exchanged some gifts, and went clothes shopping. Helena showed me her bedroom, and I tried whacking her with a butterfly net.</p>
      <p>What?! <span class="spoiler">This is on Animal Crossing. Visit my island for oranges, roses, and tulips! Seeking peaches.</span></p>

      <h2>Monday, March 23</h2>
      <p>John's spring break is over, so back to classes for him, except now they're all on zoom. He's also been using my clothes drying rack as a standing desk. (If you look closely, Kirby has returned!)</p>

      <h2>Sunday, March 22</h2>
      <p>Stata Center, 2020-03-21 15:53. Empty tables. Bulletin boards free of posters (GEL survived due to being high). Chalk art found on a blackboard. The work of stragglers left on campus? Or the result of custodial staff preserving the echoes of students who have since left campus?</p>

      <p>The Kirbys are pink, just like the cake. How many Kirbys are in the <strike>cake</strike> picture? waka waka waka.</p>

      <h2>Friday, March 20</h2>
      <p>John and I took a walk and went grocery shopping today. We thought going on a weekday after lunchtime would mean the fewest people out and about, but Trader Joe's was relatively busy for this time of day. We had to queue outside for a few minutes. It was hard to maintain six feet of separation inside the store. The atmosphere was also a bit tense, but maybe some of that was inside my head.</p>

      <h2>Thursday, March 19</h2>
      <p>One argument for staying at John's apartment in New Haven over mine in Cambridge was that he had an electronic keyboard. The ability to play music seemed like a good idea if we were going to be staying inside all day. We picked up this one (on loan from an MIT student) on Tuesday, and we finally brought it in from the stairwell today. Stay tuned for a musical post... üé∂</p>

      <h2>Wednesday, March 18</h2>
      <p>Toilet paper has been on the news a lot...not only in the U.S. but also in Japan, HK, Australia. Many people's first impressions of how the virus was affecting society were through hearing about TP shortages. Don't hoard toilet paper. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/03/18/coronavirus-toilet-paper-supply-chain.cnn-business">supply chain</a> is fine.</p>

      <h2>Tuesday, March 17</h2>
      <p>I am a TA for 6.031, Elements of Software Construction. At today's staff meeting, we tested out using zoom and webex for holding virtual office hours. I had not really used these tools before this month, but they seem pretty nifty and have useful features such as remote screen control. This picture took a laptop, a zoom session, two phones, and two Moris to create. How many Kirbys did it take?</p>

      <p>The first post is retroactive. Yesterday, I made some <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/earl-grey-yogurt-cake">earl grey yogurt cake</a>. Adam and Dhriti took some on their road trip to Princeton! (Which Kirby is me, and which one is John?)</p>

      <h2>Foreward</h2>
      <p>March 17, 2020: ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥†…™·¥Ö-19 has caused significant disruptions this year. MIT is essentially closed, all classes virtualized and lab research disrupted. Almost all the people I know are now at home, practicing social distancing. My roommates have 1) returned to Marietta, 2) followed (1) to Marietta, and 3) left for Princeton. My brother is staying with me in Cambridge, and we have decided to leave The Summit¬π only for essential¬≤ reasons.</p>
      <p>I have decided to post daily, or close to daily, slice-of-life moments here, as a way to share the mundanities that create normalcy, as a signal of our presence.</p>
      <p>Choosing a platform for this was difficult. I have a Wordpress blog, but it felt too formal to have to draft and publish posts. Too many casual acquaintances on Facebook, didn't want to clutter feeds with frequent posts. Instagram has the greatest potential, it seems, but I did not want to force non-users onto a new platform. So I have created a static page, hosted by Github Pages, that I plan to update daily. Maybe one of these days I will figure out a better content management or generation system.</p>
      <sup>¬π The Summit is the name of my apartment.</sup>
      <sup>¬≤ We really only have a weak framework for this.</sup>
